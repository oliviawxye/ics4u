For the final course project, I was tasked with building a game program that simulates planes landing and taking off. <br> 
Developed January 2021.

### Technical Details

* Used the Netbeans GUI builder to create a user interface 
* Implements timers to time takeoff and landing (4 seconds to take off, 2 seconds to land)
* Uses queues to manipulate plantes in both queues
* Implements loops and conditions, uses try-catch structures for error checking
<br>

## Caesar Cipher
